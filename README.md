# speciation_chemical
This repository contains an interactive R Shiny app designed for calculating the speciation of polyprotic acids and bases based on their pKa values, providing information on the mole fraction and concentration of the ion species at a given solution pH. 
The app also offers an interactive plot to visualize the speciation as a function of pH.
